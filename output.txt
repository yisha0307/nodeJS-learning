Relation to npm

apm bundles npm with it and spawns npm processes to install Atom packages. The major difference is that apm sets multiple command line arguments to npm to ensure that native modules are built against Chromium's v8 headers instead of node's v8 headers.

The other major difference is that Atom packages are installed to ~/.atom/packages instead of a local node_modules folder and Atom packages are published to and installed from GitHub repositories instead of npmjs.com

Therefore you can think of apm as a simple npm wrapper that builds on top of the many strengths of npm but is customized and optimized to be used for Atom packages.
